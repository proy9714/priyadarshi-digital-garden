      <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
      <p>This website started as a personal projectâ€”a humble GitHub gist where I kept track of the amazing ML resources I stumbled upon while learning the ropes. But hey, why keep all the good stuff to myself? I decided to share it with all of you struggling souls out there who are as eager to dive into ML as I am.</p>
      <p>Now, let me tell you a secret: I'm still learning every single day. That's right! I'm right there with you, absorbing knowledge, tackling challenges, and discovering mind-blowing concepts. And guess what? I'll be sharing it all right here, with you and the rest of our awesome community.</p>
